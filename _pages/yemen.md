### Two decades of Human Development already lost says UNDP-commissioned study on impact of war in Yemen  

April 23, 2019

 Ongoing conflict in Yemen has already reversed human development by 21 years, according to a UNDP-commissioned study released today. The study warns of exponentially growing impacts of conflict on human development. It projects that if the war ends in 2022, development gains will have been set back by 26 years â€” almost a generation. If it continues through 2030, that setback will increase to four decades.
